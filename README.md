# doomrl

DRL (D\*\*m, the Roguelike) is a [fast and furious coffee-break Roguelike game](http://drl.chaosforge.org/), heavily inspired by the popular FPS game 'Doom', by ID Software.

This release is dedicated to \*eniMax, and the [Jupiter Hell Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2020043306/jupiter-hell-a-modern-turn-based-sci-fi-roguelike). If you enjoy this Open Source release, please consider pledging!

This FreePascal source code release is provided as-is. Parts of this codebase date back to 2002. Please do not judge! :P 

## This fork of doomrl
I created this fork with several goals in mind:
* Make changes that fit the theme of the game and facilitate new gameplay & tactics
* Merge in features from other forks that make sense
* Improve documentation, and update changelog with each commit
